    "This study presents the methodology and implementation of an Internet of Things\n",
    "(IoT) instrumentation chain dedicated to environmental monitoring. The system is\n",
    "structured around a client-server architecture: the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi micro-\n",
    "controller board acts as the acquisition client, utilizing the I2C protocol to interface\n",
    "with the BME280 environmental sensor (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Alti-\n",
    "tude). Data transmission is ensured via the USB-C serial port. The Node-RED\n",
    "low-code programming platform is deployed as the central server, responsible for\n",

    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "Access to accurate and historically rich environmental datasets is fundamental for cli-\n",
    "mate modeling and local monitoring. The emergence of IoT devices offers opportunities\n",
    "for low-cost, high-frequency data collection solutions. The BME280 sensor is recog-\n",
    "nized for its capacity to provide three-dimensional measurements (temperature, humid-\n",
    "ity, pressure). This document describes the establishment of a complete and distributed\n",
    "architecture, solving the challenge of integrating simple hardware acquisition (Arduino)with web services for visualization and secure archiving (Node-RED/MySQL). Our con-\n",
    "tribution focuses on the detailed description of communication protocols, data analysis\n",
    "methods (parsing CSV to JSON), and the implementation of a secure insertion flow into\n",
    "a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Materials and Methods\n",
    "### 2.1 Client Hardware Architecture\n",
    "The acquisition module (Client) is centered around the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi micro-\n",
    "controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Interfacing the BME280 Sensor\n",
    "The BME280 environmental sensor is connected to the Arduino via the I2C (Inter-\n",
    "Integrated Circuit) protocol. Standard wiring requires connecting the clock line (SCL)\n",
    "to pin A5 (or dedicated SCL) and the data line (SDA) to pin A4 (or dedicated SDA)\n",
    "on the Arduino board. Power compatibility is managed (5V or 3.3V) according to the\n",
    "specific configuration of the BME280 module used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Acquisition and Transmission Protocol\n",
    "The embedded code (sketch) requires the integration of the Adafruit Unified Sensor\n",
    "and Adafruit BME280 libraries. The initialization of serial communication is set at\n",
    "9600 bauds. In the execution loop (loop):\n",
    "1. Readings include temperature (Celsius, bme.readTemperature()), relative humid-\n",
    "ity (bme.readHumidity()) and atmospheric pressure. The pressure is immediately\n",
    "normalized to hectopascals (hPa) by division by 100.0.\n",
    "2. Altitude is calculated with reference to the standard atmospheric pressure at sea\n",
    "level, defined at 1013.25 hPa (SEALEVELPRESSURE_HPA).\n",
    "3. The four readings are serialized and transmitted on the USB-C port as a CSV\n",
    "(Comma Separated Values) string, following the ordered format T,H,P,A\n",
    "(Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Altitude).\n",
    "4. A strict temporal sampling interval of 1.5 seconds is maintained between each\n",
    "dataset transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Server Processing with Node-RED\n",
    "The Node-RED platform, a low-code development environment based on Node.js, cen-\n",
    "tralizes data processing and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1\n",
    "Flow Ingestion and Analysis\n",
    "The data is ingested by a Serial in Node, whose port and baud rate (9600 bauds)\n",
    "parameters must rigorously match the Arduino configuration. The CSV string is ana-\n",
    "lyzed by a Function Node, named Parse BME280 Data. This node uses the JavaScript\n",
    "instruction split(’,’) to decompose the input string (msg.payload). Each segment is\n",
    "then converted to a floating-point number (parseFloat) and structured into a JSON\n",
    "data object, defining a clear data schema for subsequent steps:\n",
    "```JSON\n",
    "msg.payload = {temp,hum,press,alt}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Real-Time Visualization\n",
    "The Node Dashboard module is used to generate the web user interface, accessible\n",
    "locally (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:1880/ui). Gauge nodes are configured for tempera-\n",
    "ture (range 0 to 40◦ C) and humidity (range 0 to 100%), offering an immediate reading.\n",
    "Chart nodes ensure a linear graphical visualization of the history for each measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Integration for Data Persistence (MySQL)\n",
    "Archiving meteorological readings is crucial for historical trend analysis and scientific\n",
    "data sharing. The Node-RED flow is extended to integrate a MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Database Environment Configuration\n",
    "A database named meteo_iot and a table releves_bme280 are pre-configured on the\n",
    "MySQL server. The table is structured to store the measurements with the required\n",
    "precision: timestamp (default timestamp), temperature (DECIMAL(5, 2)), humidite\n",
    "(DECIMAL(5, 2)), pression (DECIMAL(7, 2)), and altitude (DECIMAL(6, 2)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Secure Insertion Method (Write Branch)\n",
    "Data insertion uses the node-red-node-mysql node. For reasons of robustness and\n",
    "security (prevention of SQL injection attacks), an intermediary Function node (Creer\n",
    "Requete SQL) is inserted after the parsing node. This node dynamically builds the\n",
    "insertion SQL query:\n",
    "1. It retrieves the numerical values (T, H, P, A) from the JSON object msg.payload.\n",
    "2. It defines the SQL command using placeholders (?) for the values to be inserted,\n",
    "assigned to the property msg.topic.\n",
    "3. It defines the property msg.payload as an ordered array containing the correspond-\n",
    "ing values [T, H, P, A].\n",
    "The MySQL node executes the secure query by substituting the placeholders with the\n",
    "values from the msg.payload array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 Results and Retrieval of Archived Data\n",
    "The system operates with two independent logical branches within Node-RED: the real-\n",
    "time insertion branch and the historical reading branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Historical Reading Flow (Read Branch)\n",
    "A distinct flow is created for the periodic retrieval of archived data. This flow is initiated\n",
    "by an Inject Node, configured to trigger at a defined interval (for example, 1 or 5\n",
    "minutes) and on startup. The MySQL (Reading) node executes a SELECT query\n",
    "directly in its configuration field. This query is formulated to retrieve a limited set of\n",
    "the most recent readings (for example, the last 50) to optimize display:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT timestamp, temperature, humidite, pression, altitude\n",
    "FROM releves_bme280\n",
    "ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Formatting for Presentation\n",
    "The raw results are routed to a Function Node (table formatting). This node is\n",
    "essential for improving user-friendliness by converting the database timestamp into a\n",
    "localized French string (timestamp_fr).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Dynamic Display\n",
    "The ui-table node displays this structured data. The table configuration specifies the\n",
    "alignment and numerical formatting (two decimal places) for each column (Temperature,\n",
    "Humidity, Pressure, Altitude), guaranteeing a clear and precise presentation of historical\n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 Discussion and Perspectives\n",
    "This architecture demonstrates the effectiveness of Node-RED in bridging the gap be-\n",
    "tween micro-controlled systems and the requirements of modern web infrastructure. The\n",
    "low-code approach allows for rapid implementation while maintaining the robustness nec-\n",
    "essary for scientific archiving through the use of parameterized SQL queries. The use of\n",
    "the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi opens significant perspectives for the evolution of the system\n",
    "towards a truly autonomous station. The current dependence on a wired USB connection\n",
    "for serial data transmission can be eliminated by using standard IoT network protocols,\n",
    "such as MQTT or HTTP. Furthermore, the extensibility of Node-RED allows for the\n",
    "integration of alert mechanisms, where additional nodes could monitor data flows and\n",
    "trigger notifications (e-mail or SMS) if critical environmental thresholds are exceeded\n",
    "(for example, a temperature above 30◦ C).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6 Conclusion\n",
    "We have developed a highly integrated and modular environmental instrumentation plat-\n",
    "form, combining the precise reading of the BME280 by the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi,\n",
    "dynamic processing via Node-RED, and secure archiving in a MySQL database. This\n",
    "model serves as a reference for creating reliable IoT solutions capable of managing both\n",
    "real-time visualization and historical management of vast environmental datasets. The\n",
    "implemented system is similar to a centralized research infrastructure. The Arduino\n",
    "Uno R4 WiFi acts as a field researcher, performing precise measurements (BME280)\n",
    "and sending them to the data center (Node-RED). Node-RED functions as the analysis\n",
    "laboratory and database manager, where raw data is transformed (JSON parsing), dis-\n",
    "played to users (Dashboard), and systematically cataloged and stored in secure archives\n",
    "(MySQL) for future consultation and historical analysis.\n",
